"""Check the correctness judge against human labels.

Every accuracy figure in this project is an LLM's opinion. This measures how
far to trust it, in two steps:

  sample  write a BLIND labelling sheet: question, reference and answer, with
          no judge verdict on it. A labeller who can see the judge's grade
          anchors to it, and the agreement figure then measures deference
          rather than accuracy.
  score   compare the judge (current version) against whatever labels have
          been filled in, and report agreement, Cohen's kappa, and which
          direction the judge errs in.

Labels are grouped by the `labeller` field and reported separately. The
rows labelled during the audit that motivated judge v2 are a DEVELOPMENT
set: they shaped the rubric, so agreement on them shows v2 fixed those
cases, not that it generalises. Only independently labelled rows are a test.

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/audit_judge.py sample --n 40
  uv run python scripts/audit_judge.py score
