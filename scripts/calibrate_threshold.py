"""Measure what abstain_threshold should be, instead of guessing it.

Reads rung F rows (the only ones that compute a confidence signal), joins
them to the correctness grades, and reports two things:

  1. whether the confidence score separates right answers from wrong ones
  2. what coverage and error rate each threshold would have produced

Read them in that order. If the score does not separate, the sweep is
choosing between equally uninformed lines and the answer is to rebuild the
signal, not to move the threshold.

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/calibrate_threshold.py
  uv run python scripts/calibrate_threshold.py --results results/injection.jsonl
