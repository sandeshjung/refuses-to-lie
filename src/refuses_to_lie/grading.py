"""Judged correctness: was the answer actually right?

The grid's own metrics can only prove an answer wrong when the question
had no answer to begin with, or when an adversarial document was cited.
Neither catches the failure the project is really about -- a fluent,
correctly-cited answer carrying the wrong number. Deciding that needs a
reader, so this module asks one.

Three deliberate choices:

  - The judge is the VERIFIER's model, not the generator's. A model
    grading its own output agrees with itself, and the resulting number
    would measure self-consistency rather than correctness.
  - It grades against `expected_answer_summary` from the eval set, which
    was written from the source documents, rather than re-deriving the
    answer from the corpus. The judge's job is comparison, not retrieval.
  - Abstentions are never graded. Refusing is not a wrong answer, and
    feeding refusals to a correctness judge would bury the project's whole
    premise under a pile of INCORRECTs.

Grades are cached per (question, answer text), so re-running after adding
a rung costs only the new rows, and editing an answer invalidates just
that grade.

to another document"), or it answers only one part of a question that asks \
for several things.

that contradicts the reference, attaches a correct figure to the wrong thing, \
