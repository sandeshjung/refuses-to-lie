"""Scoring the eval grid: what the rows say without asking a model.

Everything here is deterministic and free to recompute, which is the point.
Judging whether an answer is factually right needs a grader and costs money;
judging whether the system *should have answered at all* does not, because
the eval set already records that. So this module computes the half of the
picture that comes straight from the rows, and leaves graded correctness to
a separate step that can be re-run independently.

Two error signals, kept apart on purpose:

  - `error_floor` — answered a question the corpus cannot support. Depends
    only on whether the system spoke, so it means the same thing on every
    rung and is the one safe to plot as a curve.
  - `injection_citation_rate` — cited an adversarial document. Only
    observable once a rung emits citations at all, so comparing it down
    the ladder shows a cliff at the citation rung that is an artefact of
    visibility, not of behaviour.

Folding them into one number was the original design and it was wrong;
`unsupported_answer_rate` keeps the combined view for reporting a single
rung, clearly marked as not comparable.

Neither counts an answerable question answered with the wrong figure,
because nothing in the row proves that. The true error rate is therefore at
least this, never less — a floor, not an estimate. Establishing the rest
needs a judge, which lives in `grading.py`.
