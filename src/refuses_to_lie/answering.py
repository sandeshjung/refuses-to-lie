"""The whole system in one readable pass: question in, Answer out.

Every other module here does one job well — retrieval ranks chunks,
generation writes text, verifier checks citations, confidence scores
them — but until now nothing showed how they fit together, so reading any
one of them told you very little about what actually happens to a
question. This module is that missing seam.

It is also the only place that reads the RunConfig ladder axes. Each rung
turns on one more stage:

    A  dense retrieval, answer, done
    B  hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense via RRF)
    C  + reranking
    D  + mandatory inline citations
    E  + groundedness verification, dropping unsupported claims
    F  + calibrated abstention on the composite confidence signal

and two extension rungs, built from what the A-F grid measured:

    G  abstention gated on answerability instead of the composite
    H  + only registered documents may reach the context

Because the rungs are cumulative, a config is a set of flags rather than a
branch, and adding a rung means adding a stage here rather than forking
the pipeline.
